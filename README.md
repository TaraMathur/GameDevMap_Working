# README

This repo represents a rewrite of http://www.gamedevmap.com, a popular resource for gamers.

I'm re-writing the site in Rails, using amMaps.

Follow along here: https://gamedevmap.herokuapp.com/

If you'd like to see how the project is organized, take a look here: http://bit.ly/2Ae24Lr


Note: The development app currently only uses a miniscule subset of the data set.
